# BCI Cursor Control

Cursor control with an OpenBCI Ultracortex IV and Cyton. Heavily based on the work of Wolpaw and colleagues at the
Wadsworth Center in Albany, NY in the late 1990s and early 2000s - the "Wadsworth BCI". The primary intent of this
system is to gain confidence in the capabilities of the OpenBCI hardware and gain experience processing data from the
amplifier in real-time. Secondarily, it provides a simple and responsive system for human subject training, allowing
subjects to become comfortable with motor-imagery based BCI control.
